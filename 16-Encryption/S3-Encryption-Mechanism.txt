# Overview of S3 Encryption mechanism

Server Side Encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3):
- Requires minimal configuration
- Management of encryption keys managed by AWS
- We just need to upload the data and S3 will handle the encryption for us.

Server Side Encryption with KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS):
- Allows S3 to use KMS to generate data encryption keys.
- Gives greater flexibility of key management: deisable, rotation and access policies to CMKs.

Server Side Encryption with Customer provided keys (SSE-C):
- Gives you the opportunity to provide your own master key.
- Your customer provided key would be sent with data to S3 and S3 would perform the
  encryption of your data for you.

Client Side Encryption with KMS (CSE-KMS):
- Uses the KMS to generate the data encryption keys.
- KMS is called upon via the client, not the S3.
- Encrytion takes place at client side and encrypted data is then sent to S3.

Client Side Encrytion with Customer provided keys (CSE-C):
- You are able to utilize your own provided keys.
- Use AWS SDK client to encrypt your data before sending it to S3 for storage.
