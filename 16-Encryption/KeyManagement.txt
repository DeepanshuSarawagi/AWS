# Key Management using AWS KMS

- Rotation of CMKs
  - For security best practices, it is recommended to rotate the CMKs. The longer the each key is left in same place,
    the more data is encrypted with that key and if that key is breached, wider blast area of data is at risk.
  - We can use automatic key rotation to rotate the keys. KMS will rotate the keys every 365 days.
  - The cmkid, ARN and permissions remain the same when a key is rotated.
  - The only thing that changes during a rotation is backing key of the CMK.
  - Backing key is the fundamental cryptographic element that is used when encryptio takes place.
  - Older backing keys are retained to decrypt the data that was encrypted prior to this rotation.
  - Automatic rotation of key is not possible with imported key material.
  - We cannot change the default 365 day period of automation key rotation.
  - It is not possible to manage the rotation of AWS managed CMKs which happens every 1095 days (3 years).
  - Manual Key Rotation:
    - The process of manual key rotation requires creation of new CMK.
    - A new cmk-id is created along with a new backing key.
    - You will need to update any applications that references the cmk-id.
    - To reduce the above effort, you can use Alias names for your keys and then simply update the alias
      target to point to the new cmk-id.
    - $aws kms update-alias --alias-name DeepanshuCMK --target-key-id <new cmk-id>
  - Importing key material:
    - Key material is essentially the backing key.
    - When customer managed CMKs are generated and created within KMS, the key material is automatically
      created for the CMK.
    - However, it is possible to created CMK without the key material (backing key).
    - To create CMK without backing key, we need to select the External option instead of KMS  for Key Material option
      when creating the CMK.
    - When using your own key material, it becomes tied to that CMK and no other key material can be used for that CMK.
    
- Import key material from an existing KMS outside of AWS
  - To create CMK without backing key, we need to select the External option instead of KMS  for Key Material option
    when creating the CMK.
  - Download a wrapping key (public key) and an import token.
  - This wrapping key will be used to upload the external key material in encrypted form.
  - The import token is used while uploading the key material using public key.
  - Both public key and import token are valid only for 24 hours.
  - The key material must be in binary format to allow you to use the wrapping key.
  - Import your key material that is now encrypted with KMS and then associate with your current empty CMK.
  - Set the optional expiry date of your key material as security best practice.
  - CMK will cease to work if the age of key material imported is expired.
  
- Deletion of CMKs
  - Deleting CMK is followed as security best practice and for general housekeeping.
