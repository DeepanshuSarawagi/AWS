# Brief document on AWS KMS service

Data Encryption:
- Information is altered rendering plain text data unreadable through mathematical algorithms and encryption keys.
- An encryption key is required to revert the text to plain text.
- This encryption is categorized into two types:
  - Symmetric cryptography
    A single key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data.
    If the data was read by a different person then the key has to be shared with that person to decrypt the data.
    If the key is intercepted is during the transmission, then the data can be compromised.

  - Asymmetric cryptography
    Two separate keys are used. One to encrypt the data and the other to decrypt the data.
    Both the keys are created at the same time.
    Private keys should be kept by a party and should never be shared.
    Public keys can be shared with anyone.
    Both the private and public key is required to decrypt the data.


KMS:
- KMS is a managed service used to store and generate encryption keys that are used by other AWS services
  and applications.
- The KMS service is for encryption at rest only.
- KMS works with CloudTrail to audit and track how your encryption keys are being used and by whom.
- It is a region specific service.
