# Brief document on AWS HSM service

- HSM stands for hardware Security Module.
- A physical tamper resistant hardware appliance that is used to protect and sageguard cryptographic
  materials and encryption keys.
- CloudHSM is a physical device and is not a multi-tenant device i.e., that is not shared with
  any other customer.
- Following operations are performed using Cloud HSM service:
  - Creation, storage and management of cryptographic keys.
  - The ability to use cryptographic hash functions - HMACs - Hash Based Message Authentication Codes.
  - Cryptographic data signing and signature verification.
  - Ability to generate cryptographically secure data.
  - Assymetric encryption:
    - A public and private key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
    - Private key is not shared with the client.
    - Common algorithms are RSA, DSA.
  - Symmetric Encryption:
    - Same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
    - The key must be sent securely between the two parties.
    - Commonly used symmetric cryptographic algorithms are AES, DES, Triple DES, Blowfish

# Architecture and components of CloudHSM

- To implement CloudHSM, we need to create a cluster.
- This cluster is a grouping of different HSMs together which will act as a single unit when configured
  and deployed.
- Having multiple HSMs provides high availability as you are able to select multiple different
  subnet one from each AZ that your VPC operates in.
- Any requests to your CloudHSM cluster will load balance automatically between different
  HSM clusters.
- When HSM is deployed, a HSM ENI is placed in the VPC you select within your subnet.
- HSM itself resides in a AWS owned VPC and is located in the same AZ.
- When a HSM is deployed, a new service-linked role will be created AWSServiceRoleForCloudHSM.
- This will add the permission to send log data to CloudWatch logs.
- CloudHSM will also create a new security group for the HSM cluster. This will decide which
  resources can communicate with the HSM cluster.
- The security group itself will allow both inbound and outbound connectivity on port 2223-2225.
- Once the cluster is created, it will be in uninitialized state.
- From here on, we can create HSMs in each availability zone and initialize the cluster.
- Once the cluster is initialized, you can then connect to the cluster network interfaces
  and it can be done by an EC2 instance provisioned in the same VPC.
- Following 2 step process is required for your cluster to communicate with CloudHSM ENIs.
  - configure a security group.
    Firstly we must add the EC2 instance to the CloudHSM security group which got created earlier
    while creatinng cluster.
  - Install the CloudHSM client software on the EC2 instance.
