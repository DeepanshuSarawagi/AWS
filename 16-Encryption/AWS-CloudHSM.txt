# Brief document on AWS HSM service

- HSM stands for hardware Security Module.
- A physical tamper resistant hardware appliance that is used to protect and sageguard cryptographic
  materials and encryption keys.
- CloudHSM is a physical device and is not a multi-tenant device i.e., that is not shared with
  any other customer.
- Following operations are performed using Cloud HSM service:
  - Creation, storage and management of cryptographic keys.
  - The ability to use cryptographic hash functions - HMACs - Hash Based Message Authentication Codes.
  - Cryptographic data signing and signature verification.
  - Ability to generate cryptographically secure data.
  - Assymetric encryption:
    - A public and private key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
    - Private key is not shared with the client.
    - Common algorithms are RSA, DSA.
  - Symmetric Encryption:
    - Same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
    - The key must be sent securely between the two parties.
    - Commonly used symmetric cryptographic algorithms are AES, DES, Triple DES, Blowfish
