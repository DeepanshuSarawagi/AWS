# This document will give us a brief introduction about EC2 hibernate

EC2 Hibernate:
  - The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
  - The instance is much faster (Since underlying OS is not stopped)
  - Under the hood: The whole state of RAM is written to a text file in a root
    EBS volume
  - The root EBS volume must be encrypted
  Use cases:
    - Long-running processing
    - saving the RAM state
    - services that take time to initialize
  Supported instances families:
   - C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, M4, R3, R4 and R5
   - Instance RAM size must be less than 150 GB
   - Supported AMIs - Amazon Linux 2, Linux, Ubuntu and Windows
   - Root volume, must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
   - Available only for On-Demand and Reserved instances
