# AWS Data Migration Services

- Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS.
- The source database remains available during the migration.
- Continuous data replication using CDC.
- EC2 instance must be created to perform replication tasks.
- Using Schema Conversion Tool we can migrate the database on-prem running on one engine
  to cloud using a different database engine. Ex. On-prem to Oracle to Aurora.
