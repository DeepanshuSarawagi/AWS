# Disaster recovery and high availability using AWS

- Recovery Time Objective - is the time required to recover from a disaster.
- Recovery Point Objective - is the acceptable amount of data measured in time.
  time when the system can be restored before the event of disaster. Let's say that
  RPO is 1 hour and a disaster has occurred at 12:00PM then, the data before RPO
  time i.e., 1 hour - 11 AM should be restored
- Backup and recovery using AWS S3.
- What is the retention time for media.
- Security of archives.
- Regular testing.

- Pilot testing
- Warm standby
- Multi-Site

Replication Considerations:
- Distance between the sites - Larger the distance are typically subject to more
  latency or jitter
- Available bandwidth - The length and variability of interconnections
- Data required by your application - The data required should be less than the
  available bandwidth
- Replication technology - The replication technology should be parallel so that
  it can use the network effectively
