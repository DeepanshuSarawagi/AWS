# Brief document explaining the HA options available in DynamoDB

- Designed internally to automatically partition data and incoming traffic across
  multiple partitions.
- Partitions are stored on numerous backend servers distributed across three
  availability zones within a Region.
- DynamoDB being a managed service takes care of performing both the partition
  management and replication.
- Dialing up and down the provisioned throughput of a DynamoDB database is possible
- DynamoDB provides a second layer of availability in the form of Cross Region
  Replication (Global Tables)
- A Global Table gives you the capability to replicate a single table across 1 or
  many alternate regions.
- A Global Table elevates the availability of your data and enables applications
  to take advantage of data locality.
- Users can be served data directly from the closest geographically located table
  replica.

On Demand Backups:
- Allow to request a full backup of a table, as it is at the very moment the backup
  request is made.
- On demand backups remain in the account until they are explicitly requested to be deleted
- Backups typicalls finish within seconds and have zero impact on the table performance
  and availability.

Point In Time Recovery - PITR:
- It is an enhanced version of on demand backup and restore feature, providing you
  the ability to perform point in time recoveries.
- With PITR in place, you can simply restore back to a specific time.
- Operates at the table level and provides you with the ability to perform point
  in time recovery and for any time between the current time and the last 35 days.
- The restoration will always be performed into a new table of which you specify
  the new table name.
- Table restoration can be performed in the same region as the original table, or
  into a different region altogether.
