# Brief document explaining the HA options available in DynamoDB

- Designed internally to automatically partition data and incoming traffic across
  multiple partitions.
- Partitions are stored on numerous backend servers distributed across three
  availability zones within a Region.
- DynamoDB being a managed service takes care of performing both the partition
  management and replication.
- Dialing up and down the provisioned throughput of a DynamoDB database is possible
- DynamoDB provides a second layer of availability in the form of Cross Region
  Replication (Global Tables)
- A Global Table gives you the capability to replicate a single table across 1 or
  many alternate regions.
- A Global Table elevates the availability of your data and enables applications
  to take advantage of data locality.
- Users can be served data directly from the closest geographically located table
  replica.
