# Brief document on read replicas in Amazon RDS

- Read replicas are NOT used for resiliency or secondary instance in the event of
  a failover.
- Read Replicas are used to serve the read-only access to your database data via
  a separate instance.
- A snapshot is taken from your primary database.
- Once the snapshot is completed, a read-replica instance is created.
- The read replica maintains a secure asynchronous link between itself and the
  primary database instance.
- At this point, read only traffic can be directed to the Read-replica.
- Read Replicas are only available for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL database engines.
- It is possible to deploy more than one read replica for a primary DB.
- Adding more replicas allows you to scale your read performance to a wider range
  of applications.
- You are able to deploy read replicas in different regions.
- It is possible to promote an existing read replica to replace the primary db instance
  in the event of an incident.
- During any maintenance of the primary instance, the read traffic can still be
  served by the read replicas.
