# HA Options available in Amazon Aurora Service

- Amazon Aurora - AWS' fastest growing service.
- Database service with superior MySQL and PostgreSQL engine compliant service.
- Separates the compute layer from the storage layer.
- Separating the compute layer from the storage layer is the key architectural
  decision which allows you to dial up and down the availability of your data.
- Read replicas can be easily introduced and removed at will.
- The compute layer when launched can be provisioned in several configurations -
  providing varying forms of performance and availability.
- The compute layer is implemented using the EC2 instance, but this is a managed
  service, it will not show up in the console.
- Aurora stores data in 10GB  block, with each block being replicated 6 times
  across 3 AZs - 2 within each AZ. From an availability and durability point of view,
  Aurora can handle up to 3 copies lost for reads, and up to 4 copies lost for write.
  This makes the data highly redundant, durable and available.
- The storage layer is presented to the compute layer as a single logical volume.
- This same single logical volume is shared across all compute instances involved
  in the compute later whether it be a master or read replica - allowing the read
  replicas to accomplish the near-identical query performance as the master itself.
- With RDS data needs to be replicated from the master to each of its replicas.
  With Aurora on the other hand has no need for the replication since it uses the
  single logical volume amongst all compute instances.
