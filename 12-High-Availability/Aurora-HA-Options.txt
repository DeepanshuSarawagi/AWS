# HA Options available in Amazon Aurora Service

- Amazon Aurora - AWS' fastest growing service.
- Database service with superior MySQL and PostgreSQL engine compliant service.
- Separates the compute layer from the storage layer.
- Separating the compute layer from the storage layer is the key architectural
  decision which allows you to dial up and down the availability of your data.
- Read replicas can be easily introduced and removed at will.
- The compute layer when launched can be provisioned in several configurations -
  providing varying forms of performance and availability.
- The compute layer is implemented using the EC2 instance, but this is a managed
  service, it will not show up in the console.
- Aurora stores data in 10GB  block, with each block being replicated 6 times
  across 3 AZs - 2 within each AZ. From an availability and durability point of view,
  Aurora can handle up to 3 copies lost for reads, and up to 4 copies lost for write.
  This makes the data highly redundant, durable and available.
- The storage layer is presented to the compute layer as a single logical volume.
- This same single logical volume is shared across all compute instances involved
  in the compute later whether it be a master or read replica - allowing the read
  replicas to accomplish the near-identical query performance as the master itself.
- With RDS data needs to be replicated from the master to each of its replicas.
  With Aurora on the other hand has no need for the replication since it uses the
  single logical volume amongst all compute instances.
- Aurora uses a Quorum and Gossip protocol basked within the storage layer to ensure
  that the data remains consistent.
- Together the Quorum and Gossip protocol provide a self healing mechanism for the
  data.
- Reads operation require a Quorum of 3 and writes operation require a Quorum of 4.
- The peer to peer Gossip protocol is used to ensure that data is copied to all 6
  nodes.
- Aurora in general and regardless of the compute storage setup, always provides
  6 way replicated storage across 3 availability zones.
- In the event that the Aurora detects Master going offline, it will either launch
  a replacement master or will promote its existing read replica to the role of master.

Connection Endpoints:
- Connection Endpoints is load balanced internally using Route53 DNS.
- Be careful in the client layer, not to cache the connection endpoint lookups
  longer than their specified TTL.
- Connection Endpoints are mostly used in "Single Master and multiple read replica"
  setup.
- Below are four different types of connection endpoints.

Cluster Endpoints:
- A cluster endpoint provides connectivity to current master database instance.
  Using the Cluster endpoint allows you to perform read and write operations on
  the master database instance.
Reader Endpoints:
- Reader endpoint load balances connections across the read replica fleet within
  the cluster.
Custom Endpoints:
- A custom endpoint load balances the connections to a group of specific cluster
  instances that you choose and register. Custom endpoint can be used to group
  instances based on instance size or maybe group them on a particular DB parameter
  group.
Instance Endpoints:
- An instance endpoint maps directly to a cluster instance. Each and every instance
  has its own instnace endpoint. You can use an instance endpoint when you want a
  fine grained control over instance which you want it to service your requests.
