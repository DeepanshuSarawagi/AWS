# Network Load Balancer

  The Network Load Balancer operates at the layer 4 of the OSI model.
  Enables us to balance requests based on TCP protocols.
  The supported listeners are TCP, TLS and UDP.
  The NLB is able to process millions of requests per second
  If the application logic requires a static IP address then NLB is preferred.
  For the NLB, cross zone load balancing can be enabled or disabled.
