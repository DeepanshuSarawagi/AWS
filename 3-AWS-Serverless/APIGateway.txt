# Brief document on API Gateway

- It is a serverless offering by AWS to create REST APIs.
- This is going to be public and accessible to clients.
- When the user hits the API Gateway, APIGW will proxy the requests to Lambda function.
- Support for WebSocket protocol.
- Handles versioning.
- Handle different environments
- Create API Keys, handle request throttling
- Swagger / Open API import to define APIs.
- Handle security (Authentication and Authorization)
- Generate SDK and API specifications
- Cache API responses

API Gateway Integrations:
- Lambda Function
- HTTP
- AWS Service

Endpoint Types:
- Edge Optimized: (For Global clients)
  - Requests are routed through CloudFront Edge Locations
  - The API Gateway still lives in only one region

- Regional:
  - For clients within the same region.
  - Can be combined with CloudFront distribution (More control over the caching strategies and distributions)

- Private:
  - Can be accessible only from your VPC using an Interface Endpoint.
