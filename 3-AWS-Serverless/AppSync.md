# AWS AppSync

- AWS AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL.
- GraphQL makes it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.
- This includes combining data from one or more sources:
  - NoSQL Datastore, Relational Databases, HTTP API..
  - Integrates with DynamoDB, Aurora, Elasticsearch
  - Custom sources using AWS Lambda.
  - Retrieve data in real time with Websocket or MQTT WebSocket.
  -  It all starts with uploading one GraphQL schema.

## Cognito Integration:

- Perform authorization of Cognito users based on the group they belong.
- In GraphQL schema, you can specify the security for Cognito groups.
