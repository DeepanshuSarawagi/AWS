Auto scaling is a mechanism that automatically allows you to increase or decrease
the resources to meet the demand off of the customer defined metrics and thresholds.

Components of EC2 Auto Scaling:
  - Creation of launch configuration or launch template
    These define how the Auto Scaling group builds new EC2 Instances
    Which AMI, Instance Type to use.
    Whether public IP address can be used.
    Any user data on first boot.
    What storage volume configuration to use.
    What security groups to be used.
    If you would like spot instances.

    A launch template is a newer and advanced version of launch configuration.
    Being a template, you can build a standard configuration on how to build your
    instances using the auto scaling group.
