# This document will give us a brief introduction to EC2 Nitro

EC2 Nitro:
  - Underlying platform for the next Gen EC2 instances
  - New virtualization technology
  - Allows for better performance
    - Better networking option (Enhanced networking, HPC, IPv6)
    - Higher speed EBS (Nitro is for 64,000 EBS IOPS, for a Non-Nitro, max IOPS can be upto 32,000)
  - Better underlying security
  - Instances types examples
    - Virtualized: A l, C5, C6, D3, G4, I3en, M5
    - Bare metal: a l.metal, c5.metal, c5d.metal, c5n.metal, c6g.metal, c6gd.metal


EC2 - Understanding vCPU
  - Multiple threads can run on one vCPU (Multithreading)
  - Each thread is represented as a virtual CPU
  - Example: m5.2xlarge
    - 4 cores (CPU)
    - 2 threads per CPU
    - 8 vCPU in total
