Managing and computing batch computing workload within AWS.
We can seemlessly create cluster of resources, which is highly scalable taking
advantage of the elasticity in AWS.
Optimized distribution of the workload.
Provisioning, Monitoring and Maintaining of the clusters is taking care by AWS.

AWS Batch components:
  - Jobs
    Jobs can be a containerzed application within an EC2 instance.
    Jobs can have different state such as Pending, Submitted, Running, Failed.

  - Job Definitions
    These defines specific parameters for the job themselves and can dictate
    how the job will run and with what configuration.
    How many vCPUs, which IAM roles and EBS volumes to use to run a job.

  - Job Queues
    Jobs that are scheduled are placed into queue until they run.
    POssible to have multiple queues with different priorities.
    On Demand and Spot instances are supported by AWS Batch.
    AWS Batch will bid on your behalf for spot instances.

  - Job Scheduling
    Typically it will run on a FIFO.
    Ensures that high priority queues are run first.

  - Compute ennvironments
    These are the environments containing the resource to carry out the job
    Managed Environments - The service will handle the provisioning, scaling and
        termination of Compute Instances.
      This environments are then created as Amazon ECS cluster.
    Unmanaged Environments - These environments are provisioned and managed by
    the customer. It gives greater customization but requires greater administration
    and maintenance.
