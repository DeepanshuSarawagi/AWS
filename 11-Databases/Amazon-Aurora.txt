# This document will provide brief explanation on Amazon Aurora

- Fully managed database service by Amazon
- SQL - MySQL and Postgresql
- Distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-heals
- Replication across 3 AZs in 6 replicas.
- Upto 15 low-latency read replicas can be created.
- Aurora is a serverless database service with automatic fail-over.
- Continuous backup to S3
- Encryption at rest using KMS and Encryption at transit using SSL.
- Replication of data is performed asynchronously in milliseconds - fast enough to
  give the impression that the data synchronisation is happening synchronously.
- Master and Read Replicas use the same Storage Cluster Volume.
- Read Replicas can be launched in different AZ using the same VPC or can be launched
  as cross region replicas.
- Each Read Replica can be tagged with a label indicating priority in terms of which
  one to get promoted to the role of Master in the event of master going down.
- Aurora storage automatically grows incrementally in 10GB upto 128TB.
- Aurora is 10% costlier than RDS.
- Support for cross-region replication.
- Enabling Backtrack, helps us to rewind a Aurora DB cluster to a specific point in time.
- Aurora has a old backtrack time of 72 hours.
- Auto scaling of storage from 10GB to 128TB.
