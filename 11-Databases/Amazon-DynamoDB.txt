# Brief document highlighting Amazon DynamoDB

- DynamoDB is a NoSQL DB, which means it doesn't use the common structured query language.
- Instead it falls into the category of databases known as Key-Value stores.
- The data can be looked up using primary key of each item or through the index.
- DynamoDB tables are considered as schemaless.
- Secondary indexes of an item in a table can be used to perform queries n attributes
  that are not part of the table's primary key.
- If you want to query and match on different columns, you need to create an index
  that can do properly.
- When you write your queries you can specify which index should be used for each query.
- DynamoDB has two different types of indexes:
  Global indexes - Lets you query across the entire table to find any record that
                   matched a particular value.
  Local indexes - Can only help find data within a single partition key.
- When we create a DynamoDB table, Amazon will reserve 5 read capacity units and 5
  write capacity units.
- Provisioned Read/Write mode: Allows you to provision, set read and writes
  allowed against your database per second by your application
  Depending on the transaction, each action will use 1 or more RCUs or WCUs.
-  On-Demand mode: They are scaled on demand. This mode is generally used, when
   you are not aware of the load.
- DynamoDB is highly reliable. The data replication is between three availability
  zones within a region which happens in milliseconds.
- DynamoDB can allow upto Maximum record size of 400 KB and upto 20 global indexes
  and 5 secondary per table.
