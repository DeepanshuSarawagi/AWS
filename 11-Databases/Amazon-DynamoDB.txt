# Brief document highlighting Amazon DynamoDB

- DynamoDB is a NoSQL DB, which means it doesn't use the common structured query language.
- Instead it falls into the category of databases known as Key-Value stores.
- The data can be looked up using primary key of each item or through the index.
- DynamoDB tables are considered as schemaless.
- Secondary indexes of an item in a table can be used to perform queries n attributes
  that are not part of the table's primary key.
- If you want to query and match on different columns, you need to create an index
  that can do properly.
- When you write your queries you can specify which index should be used for each query.
- DynamoDB has two different types of indexes:
  Global indexes - Lets you query across the entire table to find any record that
                   matched a particular value.
  Local indexes - Can only help find data within a single partition key.
- When we create a DynamoDB table, Amazon will reserve 5 read capacity units and 5
  write capacity units.
- Provisioned Read/Write mode: Allows you to provision, set read and writes
  allowed against your database per second by your application
  Depending on the transaction, each action will use 1 or more RCUs or WCUs.
  Auto-Scaling can be enabled with Provisioned Capacity mode.
-  On-Demand mode: They are scaled on demand. This mode is generally used, when
   you are not aware of the load.
- DynamoDB is highly reliable. The data replication is between three availability
  zones within a region which happens in milliseconds.
- DynamoDB can allow upto Maximum record size of 400 KB and upto 20 global indexes
  and 5 secondary per table.
- DynamoDB Global Tables - Makes a DynamoDB tables accessible from multiple regions and the data replication will be
  a two way replication.
- DynamoDB TTL - Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp.
- DynamoDB Transactions - If there is an attribute/column which is common in two or more tables. And if youy want to
  sync the data between these two tables then using DynamoDB transactions, data will be written to all the two or tables
  or it will be written to None.
