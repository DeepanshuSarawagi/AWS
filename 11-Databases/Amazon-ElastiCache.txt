# Brief document on Amazon ElastiCache Services.

- Allows you to deploy, scale and operate open-source in-memory data stores in the cloud.
- This service improves the performance through caching, where web applications
  allow you to retrieve information from fast managed in-memory datastore rather than
  relying on slow disk based solutions.
- ElastiCache supports both Memecached and Redis engines.
- Amazon ElastiCache for Memecached:
  A high performance, submillisecond latency Memecached-compatible. It is in-memory,
  key-value store service, that can either be used as a cache.
  Use Cases:
    - Session Store
    - Caching
- Amazon ElastiCache for Redis:
  An in-memory data store designed for high performance and again providing
  submillisecond latency on a huge scale to real-time applications.
  Use Cases:
    - Caching
    - Session store
    - Gaming Leaderboards
    - Chat and Messaging
    - Machine Learning
    - Queues
    - Geo-Spatial
    - Media Streaming
    - Real-Time Analytics.

- Components of ElastiCache:
  - Nodes:
    A fixed size, chunk of secure, network attached RAM essentially the building
    block of ElastiCache service and supports cluster.
  - Shard:
    Redis Shard (node group) a group of upto 6 ElastiCache nodes.
  - Cluster:
    A Redis Cluster is a group of 1-90 Shards depending on if cluster mode is enabled
    or disabled. Data is then partitioned across all of the Shards in a cluster.
