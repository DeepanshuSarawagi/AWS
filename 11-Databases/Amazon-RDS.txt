# Brief document on Amazon Relational Database Services

- This service helps to provision, scale and create relational databases.
- Available database engines
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Postgresql
  - Amazon Aurora
  - Oracle
  - SQL Server

- Amazon Aurora uses the share cluster storage architecture. We have option to select
  the storage option.
- Benefits of Aurora is we are only billed for storage used and I/Os processed.
- however, other DB engines such as MariaDB, MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle, SQL Server
  we are billed for storage provisioned
- When Multi-AZ is configured, a secondary RDS instance is deployed in a secondary
  availability zone.
- When a production RDS instance is crashed/down, Amazon updates the DNS record to
  point the record to secondary RDS instance which is deployed in secondary AZ.
- The replication of data between primary and secondary DB instance is synchronous.
- During failure, RDS will update the DNS record to point to the secondary instane.
- RDS provides automatic backup feature.
- Amazon Aurora backtrack allows you to go back in time on the database to recover
  from the error.
- All the databases uses the EBS for storage, however, Amazon Aurora uses the shared
  cluster architecture.
- Using RDS Auto-scaling feature, the database instance storage can be scaled automatically.
- We need to specify the maxinum storage threshold, i.e., to what maximum extent our database
  storage can scale automatically.
- RDS backups allows you to automatically takes backup
- Transaction logs are backed up every 5 minutes.
- ability to restore to any point right from 5 minns old to oldest backup.
- Data retention period is 7 days and it can be increased to 35 days.
- Snapshots are manual backup of database.
- Data retention of Snapshot can be as long as you want.
- The database instance classes are standard(m), memory optimized(r and x) and burstable(t).

-  General Purpose SSD storage
  - Provides single digit millisecond latencies
  - Cost effective
  - SSD storage for primary data:
    - Minimum 20 GiB
    - Maximum 64 TiB (SQL Server 16 TiB)
- Provisioned IOPs:
  - Minimum of 8000 IOPs
  - Maximum of 80000 IOPs (SQL Server 40000 IOPs)
  - SSD storage for primary data:
    - Minimum 100 GiB
    - Maximum 64 TiB (SQL Server 16 TiB)

- Horizontal Scaling of Amazon RDS:
  - If the READ operation is more on the production database, then performance may
    take a hit. Hence, a Read Replica instance can be created by creating a snapshot
    of the primary instance to serve just the READ ONLY traffic. The data between the primary instance and the read
    replica instance is linked asynchronously.

- RDS Encryption:
  - At Rest encryption:
    - Possibility to encrypt the data of master and read replica at rest using AWS KMS AES 256 encryption
    - If master is not encrypted, then read-replicas cannot be encrypted.
    - Encryption has to be defined at launch time.
    - Transparent Data Encryption available for Oracle and SQL Server.
  - In-flight encryption:
    - SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in-flight.
    - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database.
  - Encrypting RDS backups:
    - Snapshots of un-encrypted databases are un-encrypted.
    - Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one.
  - How to encrypt an unencrypted database:
    - Create a snapshot of unencrypted database.
    - Make a copy of unencrypted snapshot and enable encryption.
    - Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot.
    - Update the database connection to the new encrypted database.
  - Access Management:
    - IAM roles and policies can be used to control who can manage the database.
    - IAM authentication can be used to login to RDS MySQL and Postgres.
    - IAM Authentication token has a lifetime of 15 minutes.
