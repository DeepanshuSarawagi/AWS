# This document will give us an overview of Elastic Block Storage

- Persistent storage which means data is not lost if the EC2 instance is terminated.
- EBS volumes are independent of the EC2 instances.
- They are logically attached to the instance instead of directly attached like
  instance store volumes.
- From a connectivity perspective, each EBS volume can only be attached to a single
  EC2 instance at any time. However, multiple EBS volumes can be attached to the
  same EC2 instance.
- However, Amazon has now added a new feature called EBS Multi-Attach.
- Backups in the form of snapshots can be created and it will be stored in the S3.
- If an EBS volume is corrupted or lost or for some reason not accessible, then
  a new EBS volume can be created with the Snapshot created. It then can be attached
  to the EC2 instance.
- To add additional flexibility and availability, it is possible to copy a Snapshot
  from one region to another.
- One important note to consider is that, EC2 volumes can be attached to EBS volumes
  within the same availability zone.
- Also, one EBS volume can be accessed by one EC2 instance at a time.

EBS Volume types:
  - SSD volumes
      suited for work with smaller blocks
      Two types: General Purpose and Provisioned IOPS.
      Provisioned IOPS provides throughput of 16000 IOPS with 250 MiB/S.

  - HDD volumes
      suited for workload that requires higher throughput or high blocks
      of storage. Eg; big data or logging information.
      Two Types:
      Optimized HDD - Cannot be a boot volume. Used for higher throughput
      Cold HDD - Lowest cost volume. Cannot be a boot volume. Generally used for
      low infrequently accessed data.

EBS Security:
  Possible to enable encryption during the creation.
  Used AES 256 algorithm.
  Any snapshots created will also be encrypted.
