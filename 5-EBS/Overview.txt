# This document will give us an overview of Elastic Block Storage

- Persistent storage which means data is not lost if the EC2 instance is terminated.
- They are bound to a specific AZ.
- EBS volumes are independent of the EC2 instances.
- They are logically attached to the instance instead of directly attached like
  instance store volumes.
- From a connectivity perspective, each EBS volume can only be attached to a single
  EC2 instance at any time. However, multiple EBS volumes can be attached to the
  same EC2 instance.
- However, Amazon has now added a new feature called EBS Multi-Attach.
- EBS Multi-Attach feature can allow you to attach the storage access between
  multi-instances and prevent data inconsistencies. It can support upto 16 linux
  instances that are using the Nitro system and that are in the same availability zone.
- Backups in the form of snapshots can be created and it will be stored in the S3.
- If an EBS volume is corrupted or lost or for some reason not accessible, then
  a new EBS volume can be created with the Snapshot created. It then can be attached
  to the EC2 instance.
- To add additional flexibility and availability, it is possible to copy a Snapshot
  from one region to another.
- One important note to consider is that, EC2 volumes can be attached to EBS volumes
  within the same availability zone.
- Also, one EBS volume can be accessed by one EC2 instance at a time.

EBS Snapshot features:
- EBS Snapshot Archive:
  - Move the snapshot to Archive which is 75% cheaper
  - Takes 24-72% to restore the archive.
- EBS Snapshot bin:
  - You can restore the snapshot from bin which were accidentally deleted.
  - The retention period is 1 day to 1 year.

EBS Volume types:
  - SSD volumes
      suited for work with smaller blocks
      Two types: General Purpose and Provisioned IOPS.
      General Purpose SSD:
      Cost effective storage, low latency.
      Used for system boot volumes, virtual desktops, Development and test environments.
      1GB - 16TB
      GP3: Baseline of 3000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MB/S.
      Can increase IOPS upto 16000 and thoughput of 1000 MB/s.
      GP2: Can burst upto 3000 IOPS.

      Provisioned IOPS provides throughput of 16000 IOPS with 250 MiB/S.
      Critical business application with sustained IOPS performance.
      Or for applications more then 16,000 IOPS.
      Great for database workloads.
      iO1/iO2 - 4GB - 16TB.
      Max IOPS of 64000 with EC2 nitro instances and max 32,000 IOPS for other instances.
      iO2 Block Express Provisioned SSD: Can range from 4GB - 64TB
      sub-millisecond latency.
      Max IOPS of 256,000 and IOPS:GB ratio is 1000:1
      supports EBS Multi-Attach

  - HDD volumes
      suited for workload that requires higher throughput or high blocks
      of storage. Eg; big data or logging information.
      Two Types:
      Optimized HDD - Cannot be a boot volume. Used for higher throughput. Max throughput of 500 MB/s and
      Max IOPS of 500.
      Cold HDD - Lowest cost volume. Cannot be a boot volume. Generally used for
      low infrequently accessed data.
      Max throughput of 250 MB/s and Max IOPS of 250.

EBS Security:
  Possible to enable encryption during the creation.
  Used AES 256 algorithm.
  Any snapshots created will also be encrypted.

EBS Multi-Attach:
  - Available only for Provisioned IOPS SSD Volumes of io1/io2 types.
  - Attach the same volumes to multiple EC2 instances in same AZ.
  - Achieve higher application availability in linux cluster.
  - Must use a file-system thats cluster-aware (Not XFS, EX4).
