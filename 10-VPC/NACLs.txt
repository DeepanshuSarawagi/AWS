# Brief overview about the NACLs in AWS

NACL controls the virtual network level firewall rules which controls both ingress/egress
traffic flowing to your VPC and between your subnets.

Just like Route Tables, We can have multiple subnets having the same NACL, however, only one NACL can be
applied to one subnet.
