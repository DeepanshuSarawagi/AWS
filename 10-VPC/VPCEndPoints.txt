# Brief document on  VPC Endpoint in AWS

- It allows you to connect to the supported services without configuring an Internet
  gateway, NAT gateway, VPN or Direct Connect.

- Interface Endpoints
  - These are essentially ENIs placed in subnets that act as a target for any traffic
    that has been sent to supported service and operates with the use of PrivateLink.
  - PrivateLink allows a secure and private connection between VPCs, AWS services and
    on-permise applications via the AWS internal network.
  - When an Interface endpoint has been created for your service, a specific DNS
    hostname has been created and is associated with a private hosted zone in your VPC.
  - within this hosted zone, a record set for the default DNS name of the service
    is created resolving to the IP address of your interface endpoint.
  - Requests to that servie using the default DNS name will be resolved to the
    private IP address of the interface endpoint and will route through the internal
    AWS network instead of the internet.

- Gateway Endpoints
  -  A Gateway endpoint is a target within your route table that allows you to
    communicate with the supported services. Currently the list of services supported
    by gateway endpoints are S3 and DynamoDB.
  - During the creation of Gateway endpoint you will be asked which route tables
    within your VPC should be updated to add the new target of the gateway endpoint.
