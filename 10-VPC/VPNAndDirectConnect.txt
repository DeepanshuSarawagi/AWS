# Brief document on VPN and DirectConnect and its basic differences

VPN:
  - To enable communication between your VPC resources and those in datacenters
    you can use a VPN connection across your public internet.
  - In your VPC you must attach a Virtual GW.
  - The CGW has an endpoint attached to the VGW.
  - In your datacenter you must add a customer gateway. A customer gateway with BGP
    protocol can enable dynamic routing between your VGW and CGW.
  - A connection has to be initiated by your CGW. It cannot be initiated from VGW.
  - Healthcheck pings can be setup to ensure VPN tunnel is not dropped.
  - If route propagation is enabled on your route table in the VPC, routes representing
    your Site-to-Site VPN connection automatically appear as propagated routes in
    your route table.

DirectConnect:
  - Direct Connect allows you to create a private connection betweeen your remote
    datacenter and an AWS region, not just your VPC.
  - Your datacenter will connect to an AWS partner using dedicated links which contains
    DirectConnect infrastructure.
  - This is a separate building to your remote datacenter.
  - You can configure private virtual interfaces and public virtual interfaces
    on your router for DC.
  - Private virtual interfaces will connect to the VGW within your VPC.
  - Public virtual interfaces connects to an AWS region allowing access to Public
    AWS resources such as S3.
