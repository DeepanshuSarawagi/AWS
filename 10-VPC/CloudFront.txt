# Brief document on Amazon CloudFront service

- AWS CloudFront is CDN - content delivery network service which speeds up the
  delivery of the static or dynamic content delivered to the end user based on the
  nearest edge location.
- The content of the website will be cached in the nearest edge location whenever
  a user access your resources.
- As this data is cached, after a set period this data will expire based on the
  time interval we set.
- CloudFront uses distribution to control which source data it needs to redistribute
  and where.
- For additional security, when working with S3 you can create and associate a
  CloudFront user called an Origin Access Identity (OAI). Only an OAI can access
  and serve content from your bucket preventing anyone circumventing your CloudFront.
   
Web distribution:
  - Speed up distribution of static and dynamic content.
  -  Distribute media files using HTTP or HTTPS.
  - Add, delete or delete objects and submit data using web forms.
  - Use live streming to stream a live event.

RTMP distribution:
  - Distribute streaming media with the Adobe Flash media service RTMP protocol.
  - The source data for your RTMP distribution can only exist in a S3 bucket and
    not an EC2 instance.
