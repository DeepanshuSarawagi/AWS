# Brief document on Amazon CloudFront service

- AWS CloudFront is CDN - content delivery network service which speeds up the
  delivery of the static or dynamic content delivered to the end user based on the
  nearest edge location.
- The content of the website will be cached in the nearest edge location whenever
  a user access your resources.
- As this data is cached, after a set period this data will expire based on the
  time interval we set.
- CloudFront uses distribution to control which source data it needs to redistribute
  and where.
- For additional security, when working with S3 you can create and associate a
  CloudFront user called an Origin Access Identity (OAI). Only an OAI can access
  and serve content from your bucket preventing anyone circumventing your CloudFront.
- It gives protection from DDoS attack and integration with AWS WAF, AWS Shield.

CloudFront Origins:
- S3 buckets
- HTTP Endpoints such as:
  - Ec2 Instance (Must be public, Allow public IP of Edge Locations in Security Group)
  - Application Load Balancer (Must be a public/external, Allow public IP of Edge Locations in Security Group, EC2 instances
    must allow ALB source in its security group and can be in private subnet)
  - Custom HTTP Endpoints
  - S3 Website

CloudFront Geo Restriction:
- Can whitelist or blacklist users based on their origin country IP address.

CloudFront vs S3 CRR:
CloudFront:
  - Global Edge Network
  - Great for static content
  - TTL maybe for a day

SR CRR:
  - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  - Files are updated in near real time
  - Great for static/dynamic content that needs to be available at fewer region

CloudFront Signed URLs:
- Use case: You want to share paid shared content to premium users around the world
- We can use CloudFront Signed URLs or Signed Cookies to access the private content with policies.
  - Includes URL expiration
  - Trusted Signers (Which AWS accounts can create Signed URLs)
  - Includes IP address range for which user can access the data
- Signed URL = Access to individual files
- Signed Cookies = Access to multiple files (One cookie for multiple files)

CloudFront Price Classes:
- Price varies for per GB data transfer on network for different Edge Locations.
- There are three Price classes:
  - Price Class All: All regions, the best performance
  - Price Class 200: includes most region but excludes the most expensive region
  - Price Class 100: Only the least expensive region

Web distribution:
  - Speed up distribution of static and dynamic content.
  -  Distribute media files using HTTP or HTTPS.
  - Add, delete or delete objects and submit data using web forms.
  - Use live-streaming to stream a live event.

CloudFront Multiple Origins:
- To route to different kind of origins based on content type.
- We can route content to different origin based on path
  - /api/* - We can route the CloudFront request to ALB.
  - /* - We can route the request to S3 bucket.

CloudFront Origin Groups:
- To increase high-availability and do failover.
- Origin Group: One primary and one secondary origin
- If primary origin fails, CloudFront can then failover to secondary origin.

CloudFront Field Level Encryption:
- Protect user sensitive information through application stack.
- You can specify what fields to encrypt by specifying fields if POST request is made. (Upto 10 fields can be encrypted)
- Encryption of user sensitive data happens at Edge Location and is not accessible to any downstream layers.
- Only the origin can decrypt it using the private key.
- Uses asymmetric encryption.
- Adds extra layer of security.

RTMP distribution:
  - Distribute streaming media with the Adobe Flash media service RTMP protocol.
  - The source data for your RTMP distribution can only exist in a S3 bucket and
    not an EC2 instance.
