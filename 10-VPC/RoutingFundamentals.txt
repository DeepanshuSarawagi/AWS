# Brief document on routing tables

- AWS creates and adds an implicit routing table for your VPC during the creating of VPC
- Your default routing table is known as as the routing table.
- The Main Route Table cannot be deleted.
- Subnets will be implicitly associated with the route table unless a custom rule
  route table has been created.
- A subnet can only be associated to the single route table.
- Multiple subnets can use the same route table.
- Each subnet must have its own gateway to leave the VPC to connect to the internet.
- Route propagation allows you to propagate against any virtual private gateway
  attached to your VPC.
- When enabled, routes representing your VPN connection over that VPC will be
  automatically added in the route table.
