# Brief document on AWS Global Accelerator

- Allows you to get TCP and UDP traffic from your end user clients to your applications
  faster, quicker and more reliably using the global endpoints and infrastructure/
- It uses two static Anycast IP addresses associated with a DNS name which is used a fixed
  source to gain access to your application.
- These IP addresses can be mapped to different multiple endpoints.
- Global Accelerator intelligently routes customer requests across the most
  optimized path.
- Proxying packets at the Edge location to the applications running in one or more AWS regions.
- An ENA provides high speed performance for your instance whereas AWS Global
  Accelerator provides high speed performance from end client to your application.


4 steps to setup AWS Global Accelerator:
  - Create your global Accelerator by selecting 2 IP addresses.
  - Create a listener to receive and process incoming requests based on protocol
    and ports.
  - Associate a listener with an endpoint group. Each endpoint group is associated
    with a different region and within each group there are multiple endpoints.
  - Associate and register your endpoints for your applications. ALB, NLB, an EC2
    instance or an EIP.


AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront Distribution:
- They both use AWS Global Network and Edge locations all around the world..
- They both are protected from DDoS attacks using AWS Shield.

CloudFront:
  - Improves performance for both cacheable content (images and videos)
  - Dynamic content such as API delivery
  - Content is served at Edge Location (content is cached at edge location)

AWS Global Accelerator:
  - Proxying packets at the Edge location to the applications running in one or more AWS regions.
  - Hence, Region is still serving the content instead of Edge Locations.
  - Improves performance for wide variety of applications over TCP or UDP.
  - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP address.
