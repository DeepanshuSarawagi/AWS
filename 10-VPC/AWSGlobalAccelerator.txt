# Brief document on AWS Global Accelerator

- Allows you to get TCP and UDP traffic from your end user clients to your applications
  faster, quicker and more reliably using the global endpoints and infrastructure/
- It uses two static IP addresses associated with a DNS name which is used a fixed
  source to gain access to your application.
- These IP addresses can be mapped to different multiple endpoints.
- Global Accelerator intelligently routes customer requests across the most
  optimized path.


4 steps to setup AWS Global Accelerator:
  - Create your global Accelerator by selecting 2 IP addresses.
  - Create a listener to receive and process incoming requests based on protocol
    and ports.
  - Associate a listener with an endpoint group. Each endpoint group is associated
    with a different region and within each group there are multiple endpoints.
  - Associate and register your endpoints for your applications. ALB, NLB, an EC2
    instance or an EIP.
