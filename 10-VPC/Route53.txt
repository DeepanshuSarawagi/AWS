# Brief document on AWS Route 53

- This is a DNS service by AWS.
- Provides secure and reliable routing of requests.
- Provides this service through its global network of authoritative DNS servers
  that reduce latency and can be managed via the console or API.
- Alias Records: Acts like a CNAME record allowing you to route your traffic to
  other AWS resources such as ELBs, VPC interface endpoints etc.

Hosted Zones:
  - Hosted Zones is a container that holds information about how you route traffic
    for a domain such a Google.com
  Public Hosted Zone:
    - This zone determines how traffic is routed on the internet and can be created
      when you register your domain with Route 53.
  Private Hosted ZoneL
    - This zone determines how traffic is routed within your Amazon VPC. If your resources
      are not accessible outside of your VPC, you can use any domain name of your wish.

Route 53 Records:
  Each record contains:
   - Domain/Sub-domain name: example.com
   - Record Type: A or AAAA or CNAME
   - Value: 12.34.56.78
   - Routing Policies: How Route53 responds to queries
   - TTL: The amount of time the record is cached at DNS servers.

Route53 Record Types:
  - A: maps a hostname to IPV4
  - AAAA: Maps a hostname to IPv6
  - CNAME: maps a hostname to another hostname
      - The target is a hostname which must have a A or AAAA record.
      - Cant create a CNAME record for the top node of the DNS namespace (Zone apex)
  - NS: Name servers for the hosted zone.

Route53 CNAME vs Alias:
  - CNAME only works for non-root domain.
  - Alias points a hostname to an AWS resource and it works for both root and non-root domains.
  - Alias is free of charge.
  - Alias record is always of type A/AAAA for AWS resources.
  - Alias Records can have following Record targets:
    - ELB
    - CloudFront Distribution
    - API Gateway
    - Elastic BeanStalk environments
    - S3 website
    - VPC Interface endpoints
    - Global Accelerator
    - Route53 record in the same hosted zone
    - You cannot set an Alias for EC2 DNS name.

Domain Types:
  Generic Top-Level Domains:
    - TLDs are used to determine what information you can expect when you access a
      website. For eg; .watch domain can be used by websites related to streaming.
      .clothing domain can be used by fashion industry.

  Geographic Domains:
    - .com.au for Australia
    - .com.uk for United Kingdom

Routing Policies:
  - Simple routing policy:
    - This is the default policy and is for single resource which performs a given function.
    - Can specify multiple values in the same record.
    - When Alias enabled, specify only one AWS resource.
    - Can't be associated with health checks.

  - Failover routing policy:
    - This allows you to route traffic to different resources based on the resource health.

  - Geo-location routing policy:
    - This lets you route traffic based on the geographic location of your users.

  - Geo-Proximity routing policy:
    - This policy is based upon on the location of both your users and your resources.

  - Latency routing policy:
    - This is suitable when you have resources in multiple regions and want low latency.
    - Redirect to the resource which has the lowest latency close to us.
    - Latency is measured on traffic between users and AWS resources.
    - Can be associated with health checks.

  - Multivalue answer routing policy:
    - This allows you to get a response from a DNS request from up to 8 records at once
      that are picked at random.

  - Weighted routing policy:
    - This is suitable when you multiple resource records that perform the same function.
    - DNS records must have the same name and type.
    - Can be associated with health checks.
    - Use cases: load balancing between regions or testing of a specific version of application.
