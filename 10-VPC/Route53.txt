# Brief document on AWS Route 53

- This is a DNS service by AWS.
- Provides secure and reliable routing of requests.
- Provides this service through its global network of authoritative DNS servers
  that reduce latency and can be managed via the console or API.
- Alias Records: Acts like a CNAME record allowing you to route your traffic to
  other AWS resources such as ELBs, VPC interface endpoints etc.

Hosted Zones:
  - Hosted Zones is a container that holds information about how you route traffic
    for a domain such a Google.com
   Public Hosted Zone:
    - This zone determines how traffic is routed on the internet and can be created
      when you register your domain with Route 53.
  Private Hosted ZoneL
    - This zone determines how traffic is routed within your Amazon VPC. If your resources
      are not accessible outside of your VPC, you can use any domain name of your wish.

Domain Types:
  Generic Top-Level Domains:
    - TLDs are used to determine what information you can expect when you access a
      website. For eg; .watch domain can be used by websites related to streaming.
      .clothing domaon can be used by fashion industry.

  Geographic Domains:
    - .com.au for Australia
    - .com.uk for United Kingdom

Routing Policies:
  - Simple routing policy:
    - This is the defaukt policy and is for single resource which performs a given function.

  - Failover routing policy:
    - This allows you to route traffic to different resources based on the resource health.

  - Geo-location routing policy:
    - This lets you route traffic based on the geographic location of your users.

  - Geo-Proximity routing policy:
    - This policy is based upon on the location of both your users and your resources.

  - Latency routing policy:
    - This is suitable when you have resources in multiple regions and want low latency.

  - Multivalue answer routing policy:
    - This allows you to get a response from a DNS request from up to 8 records at once
      that are picked at random.

  - Weighted routing policy:
    - This is suitable when you multiple resource records that perform the same function.
