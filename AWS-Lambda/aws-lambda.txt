# Basics of AWS Lambda
  - It is the serverless compute service that allows you to run the code without
    having to create the EC2 instance.
    The responsibility to maintain and administer the Ec2 instances is passed over
    to the AWS to manage for you.
    AWS Lambda charges compute power 100ms per use in addition to the number of
    times your code runs.

  - AWS Lambda theory working
    Upload the code to Lambda
    Configure your Lambda function to execute upon specific triggers from the supported events
    Once the specific trigger is initiated, Lambda will run the code as per your
    Lambda function using only the required compute power as definned.
    Lambda will then calculate the compute time in milliseconds to ascertain the
    cost of the service.

  - Components of AWS Lambda
    A Lambda function is compiled of your own code that you want Lambda to invoke.
    Events sources are AWS services that can be used to trigger your Lambda functions.
    Downstream resources are the resources that are required during the execution of your
    Lambda function.
    Log Streams helps to identify and troubleshoot issues that occur within your
    Lambda function.
