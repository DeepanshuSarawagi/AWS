# Basics of AWS Lambda
  - It is the serverless compute service that allows you to run the code without
    having to create the EC2 instance.
    The responsibility to maintain and administer the Ec2 instances is passed over
    to the AWS to manage for you.
    AWS Lambda charges compute power 100ms per use in addition to the number of
    times your code runs.

  - AWS Lambda theory working
    Upload the code to Lambda
    Configure your Lambda function to execute upon specific triggers from the supported events
    Once the specific trigger is initiated, Lambda will run the code as per your
    Lambda function using only the required compute power as definned.
    Lambda will then calculate the compute time in milliseconds to ascertain the
    cost of the service.

  - Components of AWS Lambda
    A Lambda function is compiled of your own code that you want Lambda to invoke.
    Events sources are AWS services that can be used to trigger your Lambda functions.
    Downstream resources are the resources that are required during the execution of your
    Lambda function.
    Log Streams helps to identify and troubleshoot issues that occur within your
    Lambda function.

  - Permissions of package
    It is essential to have correct permissions when uploading the package to AWS Lambda
    The file should have global read permissions and directory should have 755 permissions
    If right permissions aren't set then the AWS Lambda function would fail.

  - Capacity
    AWS Lambda now supports 10GB of memory required to execute the AWS Lambda function.
    Timeout - Determines how long the function should before it terminates.

  - Network
    By default, the AWS Lambda function are only allowed to access resources that
    are accessible over the internet i.e., Amazon S3. If you want your function
    to access any resources within your VPC, then we need to configure it.
    When configured, AWS Lambda then assigns a ENI to your resources using a private
    IP address.
    It is important to note that when using this configuration removes the default
    ability of using the resources over the public internet.
    To overcome this situation you must attach your function to a private subnet
    which has access to a NAT instance or Gateway.
    The execution role of your Lambda function will need to have specific permissions
    that will allow to operate within your VPC.
      - ec2:CreateNetworkInterface
      - ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces
      - ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface
  - DLQ Resource
    The Dead Letter Queue resource can be a SQS or SNS resource.
    In the event of function failing for one or more reasons, the event exception will be
    caught in this DLQ resource. These exceptions will be then handled based on the
    invocation type.
    Invocation can be synchronous or asynchronous depending upon the event source itself.
    If the invocation is asynchronous then the Lambda would retry the event further two
    more time if a failure occurs.
    If you have a DLQ resource configured then the event payload will be sent to this
    DQL resource.
    Synchronous invocations do not automatically retry the the failed executions
    of the functions.
    Enable Active Tracing - By enabling this option, it integrates the AWS X-Ray
    service to trace the event resources that invoked the AWS Lambda function.
  - Concurrency
    It effectively measures how many functions can be run at the same time.
    By default the unreserved account concurrency is set to 1000.
    This means we can have 1000 occurrences of Lambda functions running at once.

    Reserve Concurrency - Allows our function to run x number of parallel executions.
    This means that the specified function will have a reserved concurrent capaicity
    and it will be reduced from the unreserved account concurrency. For example,
    if we set it to 150, then the account unreserved concurrency will be reduced
    to 850. This further means that the particular Lambda function will have 150
    concurrent executions, and the rest other AWS Lambda functions will share the
    unreserved capacity.
  - Auditing and Compliance
    AWS Cloudtrail can log this Lambda function's auditing, risk compliance, operational
    and governance purposes.
