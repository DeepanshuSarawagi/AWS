# This document will give us brief overview of Amazon FSx.

- Provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows Filesystems on AWS.
- Easily move and migrate windows workloads requiring file storage.
- The solution is built on windows server.
- Operates as shared file storage.
- Full support for
  - SMB protocol.
  - Active Directory.
  - Windows NTFS.
  - Distributed File System.
- Uses SSD storage for enhanced performance and throughput providing sub-milliseconds
  latencies.
- Pay for the amount of storage provisioned per month and uses the metric of GB/month.
- The price varies over single and multi-AZ deployments.
- Cost also varies for amount of throughput configured on MBps/Month. Also, the
  throughput cost variation between single and multi-AZ deployments.
- Takes incremental backups thereby optimizing the storage costs.
- Data deduplication thereby removing the duplication of files from the Backups
  thereby saving 80% of the cost.
- Scale upto 10s of GBs, millions of IOPs, and PB of data.
- Storage options are SSd and HDD.
- Can be accessed from on-premise using VPN or DirectConnect.
- Can be configured to be Multi-AZ.
- Data is backedup daily to S3.

FSx for Lustre:
  - A fully managed file system designed for compute-intensive workloads such as ML and High Performance Computing (HPC).
  - Ability to process massive data sets.
  - Performance can run upto 100s of GB per second of throughput, millions of IOPS
    and sub-milliseconds latencies.
  - Integration with S3.
  - Supports cloud-bursting workloads from on-premises using Direct-Connect or VPN
    connections.
  - Scale upto 10os of GBs, millions of IOPs, and PB of data.
  - Storage options are SSd and HDD.
  - Can write the computations back to S3 using FSx.
  - Can be accessed from on-premise using VPN or DirectConnect.
  
FSx Filesystem deployment options:
  - Scratch File System:
    - Temporary storage
    - Data is not replicated
    - High Performace
    - Short term processng of data, optimize costs.
  - Persistent File System:
    - Long-Term Storage
    - Data is replicated within same AZ.
    - Replace failed files witgin minutes.
    - Long term processing or sesitive data.
