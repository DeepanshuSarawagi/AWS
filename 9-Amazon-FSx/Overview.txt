- The solution is built on windows server.
- Operates as shared file storage.
- Full support for
  - SMB protocol.
  - Active Directory.
  - Windows NTFS.
  - Distributed File System.

  latencies.
- Pay for the amount of storage provisioned per month and uses the metric of GB/month.
- The price varies over single and multi-AZ deployments.
- Cost also varies for amount of throughput configured on MBps/Month. Also, the
  throughput cost variation between single and multi-AZ deployments.
- Takes incremental backups thereby optimizing the storage costs.
- Data deduplication thereby removing the duplication of files from the Backups
  thereby saving 80% of the cost.
