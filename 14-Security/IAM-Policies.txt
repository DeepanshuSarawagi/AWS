# Brief document on different types of AWS IAM policies

- There are four different types of policies:
  - Identity Policy:
    - These policies can be attached to users, user groups or IAM roles.
    - These can either be managed or inline policies.
    - Managed policies are saved within the IAM library of policies.
    - Managed policies are of two different flavours as well: AWS Managed Policies and
      Customer Managed Policies.
    - AWS Managed policies are preconfigured by AWS and can be used by the users to
      manage some of the most common permissions to access AWS resources.
    - Customer managed policies are created by the AWS customer which can be used to
      managed access to the resources. These can also be assigned to IAM Users/Groups/Roles.
    - Inline policies are embedded directly into the entity. The policy is not saved/stored
      in the IAM library of policies.
    - It cant be replicated to other entities. It is specific to that one user it is
      attached.

  - Resource Based Policy
    - Instead of attaching to the identity, these policies are attached in-line to
      resources themselves.
    - They are inline policies which are effectively tied to a resource instead of an identity.
    - AWS S3 bucket policy is a common resource based policy.
    - Resourced based policy has the principal parameter to determine which identity
      the permissions relate to.

  - Permission Boundaries
    - These policies can be associated with a role or a user but then dont actually
      grant permissions themselves. Instead they define the maximum level of permissions
      that can be granted to an entity.

  - Organization Service Control Policies
    - These are very similar to permission boundaries in the fact that they do not
      grant permissions. Instead, they define a boundary of maximum permissions.
      These SCPs are associated at AWS account or Organizational Unit level and
      govern the maximum permissions to the members of that account.
