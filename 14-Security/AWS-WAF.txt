# Brief document on AWS Web Application Firewall service

- This is a service which prevents websites and web applications from being
  maliciously attacked.
- Two flavours of AWS WAF:
  - AWS WAF New - Used for resources created after November 2019
  - AWS WAF Classic - Used for resources created before November 2019
- AWS WAF communicates with following services:
  - Amazon API Gateway
  - Cloudfront Distributions
  - Application Load Balancers
  - AWS AppSync GraphQL API
- AWS WAF helps in filtering HTTP and HTTPS requests.
- A user would initiate the request.
- The request will be received by the CloudFront distribution/ALB/API Gateway/AWS AppSync first.
- The request is forwarded to WAF Web ACL.
- The Web ACL would filter the incoming traffic based upon rules or rules groups.
