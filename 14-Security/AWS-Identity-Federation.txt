# AWS SSO:
- AWS SSO allows you to create a Single Sign-On approach to access multiple AWS
  accounts within an AWS Organization using a single identity provider for all.
- AWS IAM Identity Center = AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Supports SAML 2.0 and also integration with On-prem AD.

# AWS IAM:
- AWS IAM allows you to configure different OpenID or SAML identity providers for
  each of your AWS account.

- SAML 2.0:
  - To integrate AD/ADFS with AWS.
  - Provides access to console or CLI.

# AWS Cognito
- AWS Cognito enables secure authentication to your web and mobile application using
  both SAML2.0 and web-identity federation.


- You have an on-premises identity provider that does not support SAML 2.0, and you want to give your on-premises
  users access to your resources in the AWS Accounts that you manage. What should you do?

  - Use a Custom Identity Broker to authenticate your users and get temporary credentials from
    AWS ST using AssumeRole or GetFederationToken STS API calls
