# Different types of storage classes

S3 Standard
  - High Throughput
  - Low latency
  - Frequent access to data
  - Durability is 99.999999999%
  - Availability is 99.99%
  - SSL to encrypt data in transit and at rest
  - Lifecycle rules to automate data storage management

S3 Intelligent Tierin
  - Ideal for data which is not frequently accessed.
  - There are two types of classes within this type of storage class.
    - Infrequent access
    - Frequent access
  - If the data is not accessed for more than 30 days, then Amazon S3 will automatically
  move the data to the Infrequent access storage class thereby optimizing storage costs.
  - Frequent and Infrequent access
  - Availability is 99.9%
  - Minimum storage duration of 30 days.

S3 Standard Infrequent Access
  - Much like S3 Intelligent Tier Infrequent access.
  - Ideal for data which is not accessed very frequently.
  - Minimum storage duration of 30 days.

S3 One-Zone Infrequent Access
  - Ideal Infrequent access
  - Durability is 99.999999999% but across a single availability zone.
  - 20% storage cost reduction when compared to S3 Standard
  - Availability is 99.5%
  - Minimum storage duration of 30 days.

S3 Glacier
  - Doesn't offer high Throughput and low latency
  - Data is not accessible immediately like other S3 storage classes.
  - Referred to as Cold Storage ideally suited for long term backups and archival requirements.
  - Durability is 99.999999999%.
  - Retrieval of data will take several hours hence data is not accessible instantly.
  - Data is stored in Vaults. We need to specify a region in which region the vaults should reside.
  - S3 Glacier has different Retrieval options and pricing differs for each options.
    - Expedited: The data retrieval should be less than 250 MB and it is typically made accessible
                 within 2-5 minutes. This is the most expensive form of retrieval. Cost is $0.03 per GB
                 and $0.01 per request.
    - Standard:  The data retrieval can be of any size and data will be made accessible
                 in 3-5 hours. This is second most expensive retrieval type.
                 Cost is $0.01 per GB and $0.05 per 1000 request.
    - Bulk:      The data retrieval should be Petabytes in size and it is made
                 accessible somewhere between 5-12 hours. Cheapest retrieval option.
                 Cost is $0.0025 per GB and $0.025 per 1000 request.
  - Data in Glacier can be stored by creating vaults using Glacier console.
  - We can create APIs, SDKs, CLIs to upload the data in the vaults.
  - We need to create retrieval vaults as well to access the data.
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  - Much like Glacier.
  - Retrieval of data will be within 12 hours.
  - Minimum storage duration of 180 days.
