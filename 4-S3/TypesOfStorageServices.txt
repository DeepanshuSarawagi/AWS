# Different types of storage Services

Storage Area Network
Network Attached Storage
Directly Attached Storage

Block Storage:
  Data stored in chunks known as blocks
  Blocks are stored on a volume and attached to a single instance
  Provide very low latency data storage

File Storage:
  Data is stored as separate files with series of directories
  Data is then stored in a filesystem
  Comparable to a NAS storage used on premises

Object Storage:
  Objects are stored across a flat address space.
  Objects are referenced by a unique key.
  Each object can have an associated metadata to help categorize and identify the object.
