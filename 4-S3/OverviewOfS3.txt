# Overview of S3 - Simple Storage Services

Amazon S3 supports largest file size upto 5TB.
The service operates on object storage system.
S3 is a regional service. While uploading the data, we are required to specify the
location in which AWS region we want to upload the data.
It will then upload the data multiple times across multiple AZs thereby increasing
the durability , availability and reducing the latency.

Amazon S3 offers durability of 99.999999999%
The availability of S3 objects depends on the storage class used, therefore, it ranges
from 99.5% to 99.99%

To store data in Amazon S3, we need to define a S3 bucket.
the name of the bucket should be unique. Since the buckets are created globally,
this is because of the flat address space.

By default an AWS account can have 100 buckets and this is a soft limit.
