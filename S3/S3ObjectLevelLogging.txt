# Object Level Logging in S3

  GetObject

- Similar to AWS CloudTrail service which records all the AWS API requests.
- These API calls can be programatic requests using SDK, or any other AWS service.
- When an AWS API request is made, AWS CloudTrail captures the event and stores the
  event in the form of log file in the S3 bucket.
- CloudTrail captures other metadata such as Identity of the caller, Source IP and
  timestamp.
