# Static website hosting using S3 buckets

- It doesnt support HTTPS requests
- The bucket and its contents must be marked as publically accessible.
- The static website hosting must have both index and error HTML documents.
- Redirect requests are possible to the target endpoint.
- Need to add a bucket policy for enabling public access to host a static website.
