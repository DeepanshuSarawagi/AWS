<h1>
  Amazon Elastic FileSystem
</h1>
<h2>
  Basics of EFS:
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Is considered as file storage which also has low latency access.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike EBS, it supports multiple EC2 instances at once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Simple scalable filesystem which can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances
      by creating multiple mountpoints on multiple AZs.
  </li>
  <li>
    It can easily scale to Petabytes in size with low latency access.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has been designed for high level throuput.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
    Storage Classes and Performace Options:
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard</li>
    <li>Infrequent Access</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Standard Storage Class
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Charges on the amount of stoage used per month</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Infrequent Access Storage Class
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Charges on the amount of Read/Write operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduced cost when compared to the standard class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spports lifecycle management similar to S3.
    </li>
    <li>
      The files are moved to IA storage class if the file is not accessed based
      on lifecycle rules.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lifecycle rules can be set to 14, 30, 60 or 90 days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the file is accessed within the lifecycle set, the timer gets reset and
      file automatically moves to standard class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any files which has size less than 128K or it has metadata about your files,
      then it will remain in the standard storage class.
    </li>
  </ol>

    Throughput Modes:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bursting Throughput - 100 MiB/Second per TiB</li>
    <li>Provisioned Throughput - Additionnal changes incur since it provides
