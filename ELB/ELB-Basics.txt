# Elastic Load Balancers

The main function of ELB is to help manage and control the flow of inbound requests
destined to the group of targets by distributing these requests evenly across the
targeted resource group.
These targets could be a fleet of EC2 instances, Lambda functions, IP addresses
or even containers.
The targets defined within the ELB could be situated across different Availability
Zones or in a single Availability Zone.

Load Balancer Types:
  - Application Load Balancer:
    Flexible feature set for your web applications running the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
    Operates at the request level.
    Advanced routing, TLS termination, visibility features targeted at application architectures.

  - Network Load Balancer:
    Ultra-High performance while maintaining low latencies.
    Operates at the connection level, routing traffic to targets within VPC
    Handles millions of requests per second.

  - Classic Load Balancer:
    Used for applications that were built using existing classic EC2 environment.
    Operates at both connection and request level.

ELB Components:
  - Listeners:
    For every load balancer, you must configure at least one listener.
    The listener defines how your inbound connections are routed to your target groups
    based on ports and protocols set as conditions.
  - Target Groups:
    A target group is a set a resources that you want your ELB to route requests to.
    You can configure your ELB with a number of different target groups, each
    associated with different listener configuration and associated rules.
  - Rules
    Rules are associated to each listener that you have configured within your ELB
    They help to define how an incoming request gets routed to which target groups.

ELB -> Listener -> Rule -> Condition -> Action (This is the ELB flow at basic flow)
