# Document on Event-Driven and Decoupled Architecture

Decoupled:
- By using a decoupled Architecture, we are building a solution put together using
  different components and services that ca operate and execute independently of
  one another.
- Each service within a decoupled environment communicates with others using specific
  interfaces which remain constant throughout its development regardless of what
  configurations are made.

Event-Driven Architectures:
- Event-Driven architectures closely relate and interact with decoupled architectures.
- However, services within an event-driven architecture is triggered by an Event
  that occur within the infrastructure.
- In AWS, an Event-Driven architecture has three components:
  A Producer - Element within the infrastructure that will push an event to the
  event router.
  An Event-Router - The Event Router then processes the event and takes the necessary
  action in pushing the outcome to the consumers.
  A Consumer - The Consumer executes the appropriate action as requested.
