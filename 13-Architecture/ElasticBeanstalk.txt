# Brief document on Elastic Beanstalk service

-  Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying applications on AWS.
-  It uses all components we have seen before: ASG, ELB, EC2, RDS.

Components:
-  Application
-  Application version
- Environment

- We can also use the Golden AMi to launch the EC2 instances which comes with prepackaged software installed.
- We just need to deploy the application.
