# Brief document explaining design and components of Simple Notification Service

- It is used as a subscribe/publish messaging service.
- SNS is centered around topics. You can think of a topic as a group for collecting
  messages.
- Users or endpoints can then subscribe to this topic, where messages or events
  are published.
- When a message is published, all subscribers of that topic receive a notification
  of that message.
- SNS is a managed service which is highly scalable allowing you to distribute messages
  automatically to all the subscribers in your environment, including mobile devices.
- SNS uses the concept of Publishers and Subscribers.
- The publishers sends messages to a SNS topic which is used as the central communication
  control point.
- Subscribers are then notified of this message in the topic by one of the following
  methods:
    - HTTP
    - HTTPS
    - Email
    - SQS
    - Email-JSON
    - Application
    - Lambda
    - SMS
- SNS offers methods of controlling specific access to your topics through topic
  policy. For example, you can specify which protocol subscribers must use such as
  SMS or HTTPS, or you can restrict access of a topic to a specific user.
- SNS and SQS can be integrated seamlessly. A Solution can be designed to send messages
  seamlessly to subscribers through a push method, while SQS handles incoming messages
  and waits for consumers to pull data.
