# AWS Outposts

- AWS Outposts are `server racks` that offer same AWS infrastructure services, APIs and tools to build your own aplications
  on-premises just like in cloud.
- AWS will come and setup the Outposts racks within on-premises infrastructure and these servers come preloaded with AWS services.
- But now you are responsible for maintaining physical security of racks.

- Fully managed service.
