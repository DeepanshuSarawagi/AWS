# Document explaining the components and architecture of Amazon Kinesis service

- Amazon Kinesis was designed to address the complexity and cost of streaming data
  into AWS cloud.
- Kinesis makes it to easy to collect, process and analyze data from various data
  streams such as Event logs, IoT devices, Social media feeds, Click stream data,
  Application data in real time or near time.
- Kinesis contains four services such as Video Streams, Data Streams, Data Firehose
  and Data Analytics.
- Amazon Kinesis Video Stream is used to do stream processing on binary encoded data
  such as audio and video.
- Amazon Kineses Data Stream, Kinesis Data Firehose and Kenisis Data Analytics is
  used to do stream processing on base64 encoded data such as logs, click stream
  data, social media feeds, financial transactions, in-game player activity, geospatial
  services and telemetry from IoT devices.



Layers of Streaming:
- There are 5 layers of streaming.

Source:
  - Mobile Device
  - Metering
  - Click Streams
  - IoT sensors
  - logs

Stream Ingestion:
  The data for streaming can be injested using following services/tools
  - Amazon Kinesis Agent
  - Amazon Kinesis Producer Library
  - Amazon SDK

Stream Storage:
  The data which is stored in this layer is done by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams which
  is called as Producer.
 - Inside Kinesis Data Streams, data can be stored but it cannot be modified. Hence,
   the data is immutable. However, the data can expire.
 - As of today, the Kinesis Data Stream can store data starting from 24 hours upto 365 days.
 - It is a high speed storage buffer.

Stream Processing:
  The Stream Processing layer is managed by the Consumers.
  - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics
  - Amazon Kineses Consumer Library
  - Amazon Kineses Data Firehose

Destination:
  Consumers send data to the destination layer which can be one of the following
  - Amazon S3
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Amazon Elasticsearch service
  - Splunk
