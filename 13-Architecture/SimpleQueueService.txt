# Brief document on AWS Simple Queue Service

- It is a service that handles the delivery of messages between the components.
- It is a fully managed service that works with serverless systems, microservices
  and distributed architecture.
- It has the capability of sending, storing and receiving messages at scale without
  dropping message data. It also has the feature of dead-letter queue.

SQS Components:
Producer:
  - Producer component of your architecture is responsible to send messages to
    your queue.
  - At this point, the SQS service stores the message across a number of SQS servers
    for resiliency within the specified Queue.
Consumers:
  - Consumers are responsible for processing messages within your queue.
  - When the consumer element of your architecture is ready to process the message
    the message from the queue, the message is then retrieved and is marked as
    processed by activating the visibility timeout on the message.
  - This timeout will ensure that the same message will not be read and processed
    by another consumer.
  - When the message has been processed, the consumer will then delete the message
    from the queue.
  - The default visibility timeout is 30 seconds and it can be set to as long as
    12 hours.
  - If a consumer fails to process a message during this visibility timeout due to
    communication error, the consumer will not send a delete message request to the
    queue.
  - If the visibility timeout expires, the message will become available again in
    the queue for other consumers to process.
