# Brief document on Amazon CloudFront Access logs

- Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network that speeds up the delivery of 
  static and dynamic contant through its worldwide network of Edge locations.
- The logging process takes place at Edge-Locations and on per-distribution basis.
- When multiple edge locations are used for same distribution, a single log file is
  created for that distribution.
- These log files are not directly written to the S3 bucket. Instead, they are retained
  by the CloudFront itself. Depending on the size, the log files, they are then delivered
  to S3 bucket. The delivery can take between one and 24 hours.
- Standard naming convention as follows - 
  butcket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/optional-prefix/distribution-ID.YYYY-MM-DD-HH.unique-ID.gz
