# This document will give us explanation on how we can achieve monitoring of CloudTrail logs using CloudWatch

We can monitor following CloudTrail logs

- API calls requesting significant changes to NACLs or security groups
- API calls to stop/start/reboot/terminate EC2 instances
- EC2 instance creation using Auto Scaling group
- Changes to security policy within IAM and S3
- Failed login attempts in the management console
- API calls that result in failed authorization
- Unsuccessful API requests due to permissions

Overview of sending CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch

- A trail is created using CloudTrail
- A log is sent to you S3 bucket and your chosen CloudWatch log group
- To deliver these logs, CloudTrail must have correct permissions
 - CreateLogStream - This enables CloudTrail to create CloudWatch Logs log stream in the log group
 - PutLogEvents - This allows CloudTrail to put log events in the CloudWatch Logs log stream
- The role name is called as CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role
- CloudWatch logs events have a size limitation of 256KB on the events that they can process
