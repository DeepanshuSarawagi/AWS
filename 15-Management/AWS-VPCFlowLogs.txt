# Brief explanation of use of VPC Flow logs

- VPC Flow logs are used to capture every data related to network flow
  and any communication within VPC or other services communicating to VPCs
- VPC flow logs can be enabled at the VPC, subnet, or ENI level to capture and
  send all network traffic to an S3 bucket.
- VPC Flow logs can now be sent directly to S3 apart from CloudWatch logs.
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too:
  - ELB
  - RDS
  - ElastiCache
  - RedShift
  - WorkSpaces
  - NAT GW
  - Transit GW

Limitations:
- For VPC peered connections, you can only see flow logs of peered VPCs
  within the same account.
- Once the VPC Flow configuration has been created, it cannot be altered.
  We need to delete it and create a new one.

  Below Flow logs will not be captured:
  - DHCP traffic within the VPC
  - Traffic from instances destined for DNS servers
  - Traffic destined to the IP addresses for the VPC
    default router
  - traffic to and from - (169.254.169.254 or 169.254.169.123)
  - Traffic relating to an amazon windows activation license from
    a windows instance
  - Traffic between Network Load Balancer interface and Endpoint Network
    interface.

 Permissions:
 To push Flow log data to a CloudWatch log group, following IAM role
 is required with relevant permissions
 This role is selected during the setup and configuration of VPC Flow log.
 You also need to allow VPC Flow Logs to assume the IAM role to deliver
 logs to CloudWatch.
 To review and access VPC Flow logs, we need following permission:
  - ec2:CreateFlowLogs
  - ec2:DeleteFlowLogs
  - ec2:DescribeFlowLogs
 The logs:GetLogData permissions enables you to llist log events from a data stream
 To create FlowLogs, you need to also grant the user the IAM permission of iam:passrole,
 which allows the service to assume the role to create the Flow Logs on your behalf.
