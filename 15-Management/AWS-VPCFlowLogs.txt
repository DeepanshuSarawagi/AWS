# Brief explanation of use of VPC Flow logs

- VPC Flow logs are used to capture every data related to network flow
  and any cimmunication within VPC or other services communicating to VPCs
- VPC Flow logs can now be sent directly to S3 apart from CloudWatch logs.

Limitations:
- For VPC peered connections, you can only see flow logs of peered VPCs
  within the same account.
- Once the VPC Flow configuration has been created, it cannot be altered.
  We need to delete it and create a new one.
  
  Below Flow logs will not be captured:
  - DHCP traffic within the VPC
  - Traffic from instances destined for DNS servers
  - Traffic destined to the UP addresses for the VPC
    default router
  - traffic to and from - (169.254.169.254 or 169.254.169.123)
  - Traffic relating to an amazon windows activation license from
    a windows instance
  - Traffic between Network Load Balancer interface and Endpoint Network
    interface.
    
 Permissions:
 To push Flow log data to a CloudWatch log group, following IAM role
 is required with relevant permissions
 You also need to allow VPC Flow Logs to assume the IAM role to deliver
 logs to CloudWatch.
