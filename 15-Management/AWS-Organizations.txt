# Brief document explaining the key components and use of AWS Organizations service

- AWS Organizations can be used to manage multiple AWS accounts in an Organization.
- Cost optimization and billing
- Security and governance
- Management and control of workloads
- Resource grouping
- Helping to define business units

AWS Organizations components:
Organizations:
- An Organization is an element that serves to form a hierarchical structure of multiple
  AWS accounts.
- It provides a graphical view of your entire AWS account structure.

Root:
- It is a container that resides on tope of your Organization. All of your AWS
  accounts and Organizational Units will sit underneath this Root.
- There can only be one single Root object.

Organizational Units
- They provide means of categorizing multiple AWS accounts.
- Like Root, they are just containers, that allow you to group together specific
  AWS accounts together.
- They can connect directly below Root or another OU. OUs can be nested 5 times.

Accounts:
- These are essentially AWS accounts which you use to configure AWS resources.

Service Control Policies:
- They control what services and features are accessible from within an AWS account.
- These SCPs can either be associated with a Root, OU or directly AWS accounts.
- When an SCP is applied to any of these objects, its associated controls are fed
  down to all of its child objects.

Benefits:
- Centrally manage policies of all AWS accounts from Master account.
- Consolidated billing of all AWS account.
- Categorization and grouping of AWS accounts.

Process of setting up AWS organizations:
- Setting up of AWS Orginzations requires a Master account. This Master account should not be used 
  for anything else such as configuring resources. The sole purpose of this AWS master account is
  to centrally manage other AWS accounts using AWS Organizations service.
 - If we want to setup service control policies, we need to enable all features in AWS master account.
