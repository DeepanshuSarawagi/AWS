# Brief document on working of AWS CloudTrail service

- Records and tracks all API requests on your AWS account.
- Example: When an Auto scaling policy makes an API request to launch three new
  EC2 instances, CloudTrail records API requests made by Auto scaling policy and
  delivers the logs to AWS S3.
- Every API request captured is recorded as an Event.
- Multiple events are recorded within AWS CloudTrail logs.
- Events contain an associated metadata, such as
  Identity of the caller
  Timestamp of the request
  Source IP address
- New log files are created every 5 mins and are stored in S3.
- CloudTrail logs can also be delivered to CloudWatch logs for metrics monitoring
  and alerting via SNS.
- It is a global service which supports all regions.
- Effective for security analysis.
- Monitors restricted API calls.
- Resolve day-to-day operational issues
