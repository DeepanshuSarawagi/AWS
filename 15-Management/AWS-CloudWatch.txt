# Brief document on Amazon CloudWatch

- Designed for monitoring health and operation performance.
- Features of CloudWatch
  - CloudWatch Dashboards
    We can create dashboards using AWS Management console or using CLI by calling
    PutDashboardAPI to build and customize page using different visual widgets.
    We can monitor resources in multiple different regions using dashboards.
  - Default monitoring records metrics every 5 minutes, detailed monitoring records
    metrics every 1 minute at additional cost.

  - CloudWatch Metrics and Anomaly Detection
    Metrics enables you to monitor a specific element of an application or a resource
    over a period of time while tracking these data points.
    - Disk Reads/Writes
    - NumberOfObjects - specific to S3
    - Creating customised is regional. A metric cannot be available for another region.
    Allows CloudWatch to implement ML algorithms against your data to help detect
    any activity which is outside of the normal baseline parameters that are
    generally expected

  - CloudWatch Alarms
    CloudWatch Alarms tightly integrate with Metrics and allow you to create automatic
    actions based on specific thresholds that you configure relating to reach metric
    Can be easily integrated with dashboards.

  - CloudWatch EventBridge
    EventBridge connects to your own application allowing to respond to your events
    that occur in your application.
    Has evolved from an existing feature called Amazon Events.
    An event is anything that causes change to your environment or application.
    CloudWatcch EventBridge supports following targets
      - Amazon EC2
      - Amazon Lambda
      - Amazon Kinesis Data Stream
      - Amazon Kinesis Data FireHose
      - Amazon SNS and SQS queues
      - Amazon CloudWatch Logs
      - Amazon Batch jobs
      - CodeBuild Projects
      - AWS CodePipeline
      - EC2 CreateSnapshot, EC2 RebootInstances, EC2 StopInstance, EC2 TerminateInstances
        API calls
      - Amazon API Gateway REST API Endpoints
      - Amazon Redshift clusters
    Rules:
      Acts as a filter for incoming streams of event traffic and routes these events
      to appropriate targets defined within the Rule.
      Rule itself can route events to multiple targets, however, targets must be in
      the same region.
    Targets:
      Targets are where the events are sent by the Rules.
    Event Bus:
      It is the component that actually receives the events from your application
      and your rules are associated to specific event bus.

  - CloudWatch Logs
    Gives you a centralized location to house all of your logs from different AWS
    services which provides logs as an output, such as CloudTrail, EC2, VPC Flow Logs etc.
    Acts as a central repository for real time monitoring of all the log data.
    Can utilize Insights to get overview of logs in real-time and take actions
    as needed.
    Unified CloudWatch Agent can collect logs and additional metric data from EC2
    instances as well as from on-premise services running either a linux or windows
    operating system
    CloudWatch Agent installation requires creation of role and attaching it to the
    instance with permissions to collect the data and also interacting with AWS SSM
    Download and install the agent on EC2 instance.
    Configure and restart the EC2 instance.
    The most efficient of achieving this is to use the EC2 systems manager.
    For installing Unified CloudWatch Agent using EC2 Systems Manager, we need to
    create two roles:
      - EC2 Allows EC2 instances to call AWS services on your behalf
        Use to install the agent and send the metrics to CloudWatch with policies
        (CloudWatchAgentServerPolicg and AmazonEC2RoleforSSM)
      - Used to communicate with the parameters store within Systems Manager, to store
        the configuration information file of the agent which then can be shared with
        other EC2 instances for Agent installation. (CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy and AmazonEC2RoleforSSM)
      - Once the configuration file of agent is stored, we need to detach the policy from EC2 instance.
      - For security reason, only one EC2 instance needs to be attached with agent configuration role
        policy.

  - CloudWatch Insights
    They provide the ability to get more information from the data that CloudWatch
    is collecting.
    Three different types of Insights:
    Log Insights:
      This is a feature that can analyze logs that are collected by CloudWatch logs
      at scale in seconds using interactive query and deliver visualizations
    Container Insights:
      Allows you to collate and group different metric data from different container
      services and applications running on AWS. Example, EKS and ECS.
      It also monitors and captures diagnostic data which can be used to take necessary
      actions.
      This monitoring and insight data can be used to collect data at cluster, node,
      pod and task level.
    Lambda Insights:
      Feature to gain deeper underdstanding about the applications using AWS Lambda.
