# This document will give you an overview of VPC in AWS.

A VPC is an isolated environment which allows you to provision your resources
within cloud which is accessible and visible only by you.

Subnetting is a process of splitting the CIDR block into a smaller CIDR blocks
using subnet masks. Subnetting allows you to logically divide your network for
different tiers which increases security of your infra.

A subnet can only belong to one routing table.
Multiple subnets allow you to restrict resources in certain subnets to specific
destinations via these defined routes.

Subnets in a VPC contains following information:
  - Summary; which has following further detailed metadata
    - SubnetID
    - IPv4CIDR
    - Status
    - Available IPs
    - VPC
    - Availability Zone
    - Route Table
    - Network ACL
    - Default Subnet?
    - Auto Assign Public IP?
    - Auto Assign IPv6 IP?

  - Route table
    - All route destinations and targets are shown in this table

  - NACL
    - Network Access Control Lists provide a rule-based tool for filtering ingress
      and egress traffic of your subnet
    - NACL are stateless

  - Flow logs

Public and Private Subnets:

  - Public subnets have direct access to the internet while private subnets don't.
  - An internet gateway IGW must be attached to your VPC to get access to the internet.
  - However, the instances within your VPC will not have an understanding on how
    to get to the internet.
  - Hence, here comes in the route table. The route table will have IGW as target
    with destination as 0.0.0.0/0
  - Instances within a public subnet requires a public IP address.
  - Ensure any NACLs for the public subnet are not restricting any traffic.

  IP addressing behaviour for assigning Public IP address within a public subnet:
    - Public IP addresses can be automatically assigned or can be assigned manually.
    - By default all subnets have automatic assignment of public ip addresses disabled.
    - By design, the public IP addresses are assigned from the AWS resource pool.
    - Once the instance no longer requires it, the ip is returned back to the pool.
    - If you want to reuse the public IP address again and again, it is better to
      assign an Elastic IP address.
