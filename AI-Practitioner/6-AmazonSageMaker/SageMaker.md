# SageMaker AI

## Introduction:
- Fully managed AI service for developers/data scientist to build ML models.
- Helpful in performing all the tasks and provision servers for ML models and training them, monitoring the performance of model.
- has built-in algorithms.
- has ability for Automatic Model Tuning.
- Model deployment and inference:
  - Deploy to deploy model with one click; automatic scaling.
  - Deployment can be Real-Time or Serverless.
- Asynchronous deployments for payloads more than 1 GB in size; provides near real-time latency requirements.
- Batch deployments for an entire dataset; request and response are on S3.
