## Introduction to Prompt Engineering:

- Prompt gives little guidance and leaves a lot to model's interpretation.
- `Prompt Engineering` = developing, designing, and optimizing prompts to enhance the outputs of FMs for your needs.
- Improved prompt technique consists of:
  - **Instructions:** A task for the model to do
  - **Context:** External information to guide this model.
  - **Input data:** the input for which you want a response.
  - **Output indicator:** the output type or format.
