## AI:
- AI is a broad field for the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence:
  - Perception
  - Reasoning
  - Learning
  - Problem Solving
  - Decision-making
- Umbrella-term for various techniques.

### AI Components:

- **Data Layers:** Collect vast amount of data.
- **ML Framework and Algorithm Layer:** Data Scientists and Engineer work together to understand use cases, requirements, and frameworks
    that can solve them.
- **Model Layer:** Implement a model and train it, we have the structure, the parameters and functions, optimizer function.
- **Application Layer:** How to serve the model and its capabilities for your users.

## Machine Learning:

- ML is a type of AI for building methods that allow machines to learn.
- Data is leveraged to improve computer performance on a set of task.
- Make predictions based on the data used to train the model.
- Following example [referenced from SimpliLearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/regression-vs-classification-in-machine-learning-article) shows a classic example of Machine Learning.
  - **Regression:** Able to determine the trend and prediction based on the dataset.
  - **Classification:** Able to classify between distinctive datasets.
- No explicit programming of rules is required. Algorithm will take care of finding patterns from the data provided.

## Deep Learning:
- Subset of ML, uses neurons and synapses to train a model.
- Process more complex patterns in the data then traditional ML.
- There is more than one layer of learning.
- Ex: Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection, image segmentation.
- Ex: Natural Language Processing: text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, language generation.
- Requires large amount of input data.
- Requires high GPU for parallel computations.


### Neural Networks:

- As illustrated in the below diagram, nodes are connected together.
- Nodes are organized in layers.
- When the neural networks sees a lot of data, it identifies patterns and changes the connections between the nodes.
- Nodes are talking to each other, by passing on data to the next layer.
- Neural networks may have billions of nodes.
